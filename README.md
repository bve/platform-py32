# platform-py32f0

PlatformIO platform for PY32F0xx devices.

The supported framework is https://github.com/positron96/framework-py32f0sdk which
  has HAL and LL libraries.
There is no Arduino core in this project.

The project is heavily based on https://github.com/IOsetting/py32f0-template repository.


At the moment, the only supported upload/debug tool is blackmagic probe
(which supports PY32 since mid-2024).
